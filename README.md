# ragemp-roleplay-gamemode

After around **7 months of development**, I'm excited to share this **RPV-based game mode** with the community. The game mode is **nearly bug-free**, **fully translated into Turkish**, and features **completely redesigned UI elements**.

This project is built on top of the [RPV framework](https://github.com/xaniz/rpv_ragemp), and it introduces several custom systems, including a **detailed fishing job** and **dynamic zone management**.

## A Note from the Developer

I started working on this project as I was learning **C#**, so you may notice some **unoptimized** or **logically flawed** code in certain areas. However, it is functional and robust enough to be launched with a bit of final polish.

## Need Help?

For a **limited time**, I'm offering **free support** for any issues you encounter with the mod via Discord.

## Features

Here are some of the main features (more to be added later):

* Completely revised UI
* Full Turkish translation
* Detailed **fishing job system**
* **Dynamic zones** (safe zones, fishing zones, etc.)

> You can explore these systems further by running and testing the mode.
